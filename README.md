Mining Massive Datasets

MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM:
Part 1: Building the recommendation system 

Step 1: Optimizing the Loss function with ALS:
First divide the dataset into Training, Test and Validation and then use the product of factors technique and optimize the loss function by changing various features of the ALS model (mainly: rank).
Check for the lowest RMSE value and select that as our best model.
Then get train the best model and predict the test dataset with the best model and then get the optimal values for test dataset- RMSE, MSE.
Map to find the respective Files for this task:

Sample Output:
For rank 5
MSE is 0.665895305582
RMSE is 0.816024083948
For rank 8
MSE is 0.656784463945
RMSE is 0.810422398472
For rank 12
MSE is 0.654998883731
RMSE is 0.809320013178
The best model was trained with rank 12
For testing data
MSE: 0.654945811622
RMSE is 0.809287224428
    
Step 2: Evaluating the Model (Cross Validation)
First run the shell script to get the 5 folds for cross validation.

README.html
Now, repeat the experiment with each training and tests sets and average the result (RMSE, MSE and MAP)
For getting the MAP value, Rankingmetrics is used

Sample Output:
('The MSE value after Cross Validation is: ' 0.6183384684207281) ('The RMSE value after Cross Validation is: ' 0.7863454672983216) ('The MAP value after Cross Validation is: ' 0.8078338976328463)

Remarks:
Based on the results above, the model is successfully evaluated using 5 â€“ fold cross validation. The MSE and RMSE values closely match each other with the values of the best model (recommendation.py).
      
Part 2: Adding the user to the Database
Add a new user with User Id =0, (Because 0 is not there as a user Id in the database), and provide ratings to a few movies (rated almost 15 movies). Then use the best model (with rank =12) to get the predictions for this particular user for the movies he has not rated. Sample output below shows about 10 predicted recommendations.

Sample Output:
Rating(user=0, product=6400, rating=3.9777418987988806),
Rating(user=0, product=81100, rating=3.0627367990520633),
Rating(user=0, product=105040, rating=2.7796447539317217),
Rating(user=0, product=88400, rating=3.786483724058922),
Rating(user=0, product=7020, rating=4.037491579364013),
Rating(user=0, product=65845, rating=3.2159465610092024),
Rating(user=0, product=32170, rating=3.841737853358807),
Rating(user=0, product=1325, rating=2.168484237962208),
Rating(user=0, product=113470, rating=3.8084120904941567),
Rating(user=0, product=100270, rating=3.6606904291868267),
